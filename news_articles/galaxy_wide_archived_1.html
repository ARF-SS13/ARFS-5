Hello folks, today has been a good and progressive day for some Empires of the galaxy.
The... A.R... that stands for Athorian Republic for yall out there who arn't in the outer edge systems, they have announced that they will be changing some laws, a Commander in the A.R. Civil Protection Command stated, "These laws have remained the same for several hundred years, while we are not sure if the change will be permanent, we do hope it improves our standing in the galactic community, we will give further details later on in the prossess. thank you." this is intresting to say the least.

Hello hello! We have some travel related news coming right your way. Increased Sol Gov naval ships have been seen along the outer edge systems most likely requested to be there to help stop cargo ships from going missing. in other places related to space ships, a ship was shot down by local defences after the ship failed to request permission to land, so remember people ALWAYS request to land before you land because it seems that some places will give a lethal responds, luckly for the ship that was shot down, no major casualties was reported... Oh and we just got word... A ship of great scale was reported earlyer today, but apon further investigations, it was just a oddly shaped asteroid. Thats all we have for now, stay tuned!

Hello, today we have news regarding the missing cargo ships in the outer edge systems. With Sol Gov support, the United Galactic Protection Services (U.G.P.S.) found that vox pirates were the ones attacking the cargo ships, it was also descovered that the vox pirates were taking weapons and phoron from the ships, the weapons stolen have been from reports, sold on the black market. When we asked one local colonist in particuler, 'What do you think of the pirate situation' they replyed, "Im worried about being attacked and our security force not being able to protect us." Sol gov when asked the same question did not give a responds, but when we asked the U.G.P.S. Commander John Wolf, "What do you think of the pirates and the black market situation in the outer edges systems?" he replyed "We have the situation under control, we will be sending more crusiers to reinforce the colonies that are under our protection, as for the black market ordeal we are currently trying to reclaim everything that was stolen."

Hello folks of the galaxy, today we got word that employees of a NT station called, Yawn Wider have been unlawfully going to the stations Central Command, we don't have all the details but when we asked a NT official Mitch Milburn about it they said, "We have recently received reports from the officers aboard Yawn central command about an increased number of personnel in space suits entering the perimeter. Entering central command's perimeter without permission from the officers aboard is highly illegal and if any personnel is spotted doing so we cannot guarantee their safety." and thats whats going on in Virgo. In other parts of the galaxy, Strog Industries (S.Ind) from reports they have been looking into augmentation of the Vox, we attempted to ask S.Ind about this but they denied any claims we will be looking into this further.

Hello people of the galaxy! Today we have news of NT apparently presenting evidence of slavery that the robotics industry giant of Ro.Co. are suspected of doing. We investigated by interviewering a NT offical where they stated the following, "We have recently hired someone in the Virgo system and we found that they had a tracking implant featuring Ro.Co. designs, we are still looking into it to confirm our suspicions, I would go into further detail but I am unable to at this time."
With that said we also asked a Ro.Co. offical and they deny any claims to slavery stating, "We do not have illegal slaves not do we support such a terrible act, the tracking implants are just being used for employees that have commited crimes in the past so we are very suprised that NT would go to such great lengths to hurt our company." There will be court hearings in the coming week, stay tuned for more information!

Sol Gov's 12th fleet reportedly went into A.R. (Athorian Republic) space and attacked a fleet of A.R.M. ships, the 12th Sol Gov fleet were severely damaged and surrendered to the A.R.M. fleet, reportedly the A.R. will be charging the 12th Sol Gov fleet for breaking border laws both Sol Gov and the A.R. have not stated anything to the press as of yet.
<br>
In other parts of the galaxy.. population growth in a outer system of Virgo has caused food and water shortages. Support organizations have come in to try and help this issue... Core systems such as Sol have had pirate trouble as city crime rates and ship disappearances go up.
<br>
A.R. have issued a temperary ban on Vox being in A.R. space due to pirates and aggression from the Vox, A.R. Offical Kalgar Misko stated, "With this ban this will allow A.R.M. system defences to meet Vox pirates with lethal force rather then attempting to arrest them." We here at G.W.N. ask Kalgar, "Does the A.R. see the Vox as a galactic empire?" Kalgar replied, "No.. the A.R. has deem the vox as a remnant class civilization, which means we can't declare war on them, but if they show to much aggression we can have them marked as a threat to our empire." We attempted to get more info but there was nothing more we could get.
<br>
Mercenary and Security organizations across the outer edge of human space have clashed, it would seem from reports that companies in those areas are hiring mercs to attack security companies, this has ranged from attacking supply ships to attacking outpost.

Hello folks! Today we have more reports of pirates in human space.
A medical freighter was raided by pirates, the suspects leader has not been identified but from video surveillance the leader is a human male with red eyes and assumed to be blonde with a pony tail and has pale skin, Local security in the system have requested that if anyone fits this description to report it to your local system security department.
Other info on the pirate crew is sparse but it was multi crew (more then one race.) and the humans from surveillance appeared to only talk through hand motions.
